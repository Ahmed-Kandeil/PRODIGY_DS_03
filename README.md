# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

Welcome to the Decision Tree Classifier repository for customer purchase prediction! This repository documents Task 3 of my data analysis journey, focusing on building a decision tree classifier to forecast customer purchases based on demographic and behavioral data.

## Task Overview

Task 3 involved the development of a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior using demographic and behavioral data. The primary goal was to construct a model capable of accurately predicting whether a customer will purchase a product or service.

## Key Insights

- **Model Development:** Constructed a decision tree classifier using Python's scikit-learn library, incorporating features such as age, income, previous purchases, etc., to predict purchase outcomes.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Employed metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune parameters for optimal results.
- **Interpretability:** Explored the decision tree's structure to gain insights into the factors influencing customer purchase decisions.

## Knowledge Gained

Task 3 provided practical experience in building and evaluating machine learning models for predictive analytics. This task enhanced skills in model development, evaluation, and interpretation, essential for deriving actionable insights from data.
